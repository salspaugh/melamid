## Data Exploration Process

1. Glance through the data set metadata to come up with an initial high-level question or two.
2. For a given question, examine the data set metadata more closely to choose colummns most relevant to the question.
3. Correlate all columns with one another to find the columns most likely to affect the columns in the question.
4.

#### What do children who get in trouble have in common?

First, I had to decide what "get in trouble" means.
This could be defined by any one or combination of the following columns:

* BYS43 Number of cigarettes respondent smokes per day
* BYS55A I was sent to the office because I was misbehaving
* BYS55B I was sent to the office because of problems with my school work
* BYS55C My parents received a warning about my attendance
* BYS55D My parents received a warning about my grades
* BYS55E My parents received a warning about my behavior
* BYS55F I got into a physical fight with another student
* BYS56E Other students in class see you as a trouble-maker
* BYS76 How often do you cut or skip classes
* BYRISK BY risk of dropping out of school
* F1S10A I was late for school
* F1S10B I cut or skipped classes
* F1S10C I got in trouble for not following school rules
* F1S10D I was put on an in-school suspension
* F1S10E I was suspeneded or put on probation from school
* F1S10F I was transferred to another school for disciplinary reasons
* F1S10G I was arrested
* F1S77 How many cigarettes does respondent smoke per day
* F1S78A In lifetime, number of times had alcohol to drink
* F1S0AA In lifetime, number of times respondent used marijuana
* F1S80AA In lifetime, number of times taken cocaine

Focusing on just column, BYS55A, I found it to be correlated with a large number of other variables.
